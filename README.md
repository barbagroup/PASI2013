#PASI 2013 Lessons, in Python 
##"The science of understanding tsunamis, storm surges and tidal phenomena"
###Valparaiso, Chile (Jan. 2013)
####with funding from NSF and DOE under the PASI program, and additional support from ONR Global, Santiago.

These lessons were prepared during Fall 2013, inspired by some of the lecture notes from the mini-courses at the PASI (Jan. 2013) and background material from Prof. Barba's CFD course. They present foundations to understanding mathematical models such as waves and shallow-water phenomena.

The institute was led by [Prof. Lorena A. Barba](http://lorenabarba.com/)  and the instructors were:

- [Cheryl Ann Blain](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/cheryl-ann-blain/), Oceanography Division, Naval Research Laboratory
- [Donna Calhoun](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/donna-calhoun/), Department of Mathematics, Boise State University
- [Changsheng Chen](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/changsheng-chen/), Department of Fisheries Oceanography, School for Marine Science and Technology, University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth
- [David George](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/david-george/), U.S. Geological Survey
- [Philip Liu](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/philip-liu/), School of Civil and Environment Engineering, Cornell University
- [Patrick Lynett](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/patrick-lynett/), Department of Civil Engineering, University of Southern California
- [Ridgway Scott](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/l-ridgway-scott/), Departments of Computer Science and Mathematics, University of Chicago
- [Tim Warburton](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/tim-warburton/), Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University

You can find brief biographies of the instructors on the [People](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/people/) page of the institute.

[Materials](http://www.bu.edu/pasi-tsunami/materials/) from the institute include lecture notes (presentation slides), and several videos recorded as screencasts during lecture.
